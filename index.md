*Do you use the Twin Cities bus, train, or light rail to commute regularly to work?*

*Do you know the routes and stops that you use in the morning and afternoon, but don't necessarily have the departure times memorized?*

*Or maybe you have the schedule memorized but hate it when the bus runs late due to weather.*

**RadBus** may be your ticket to a more predictable commute!  Once it knows your schedule, RadBus can tell you your departure times in realtime, when you need them most.

## The Web App

You can tap into the power of RadBus right now using our full-featured web client.  It works on your desktop, tablet, and phone - so you can use it wherever you go.

And guess what?  The web app is actually an open source project on GitHub!

## The Web API

Wish you could tap into all this RadBus goodness from your own app?  Now you can!  The **RadBus Web API** can be used by apps to uptain upcoming Twin Cities Metro Transit departure information for their users.  For simplicity and consistency, it pulls departure data based on a user's preconfigured schedule stored in the cloud.

The RadBus Web API is also an open source project, and it's built by people participating in the Twin Cities software development community who rely on Metro Transit to get to and from work every day:
